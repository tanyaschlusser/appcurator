Goals
=====

  0. Learn some Python
  1. Create a database containing apps and reviews of apps

      a. Design the structure of the database
      b. Implement

  2. Create a webpage that interacts with and shows the contents
     of the database, using Django

  3. Populate the database with apps found by searching the internet
     for health-related apps


Getting started
===============

You need to install Flask, pg8000, and other libraries
in the 'requirements.txt' file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don't want to do this in your own environment,
you can do it in a virtual environment:

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ## to deactivate the virtual environment,
    ## just type 'deactivate' (without quotes)
